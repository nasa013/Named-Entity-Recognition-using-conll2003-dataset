# üè∑Ô∏è **Named Entity Recognition (NER) Project** 

### **Overview**
This project focuses on **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** using a **Random Forest classifier**. The objective is to identify and classify named entities in text, including:  
- **Persons**  
- **Organizations**  
- **Locations**  
- **Miscellaneous Entities**  

The workflow includes **data preprocessing**, **feature extraction**, **model training**, **evaluation**, and a **graphical user interface (GUI)** for real-time NER predictions.

### üåü **Features**
1. **üì• Data Loading and Preprocessing**  
   - Load and preprocess the **CoNLL-2003 dataset** to prepare it for training.  

2. **üìä Feature Extraction**  
   - Extract meaningful features, including **word embeddings** with **Word2Vec**.  

3. **üß† Model Training**  
   - Train a **Random Forest classifier** on the extracted features for high accuracy.  

4. **üìà Model Evaluation**  
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like **accuracy** and **classification reports**.  

5. **üñ•Ô∏è GUI Integration**  
   - Link the trained model with a **CustomTkinter GUI** for interactive, real-time NER predictions.
